# Connect 4
Project implementing Connect 4 logic and developing a GUI with PyGame.

## How to play
Please make sure to have PyGame installed. If it is not already, type `pip install pygame` into the terminal.

The default is two players playing Connect 4. The standard board is the same as the physical game, 7 columns x 6 rows. From the terminal command line, to play, after downloading the code, run `python3 src/gui.py`.

The game is set up as Connect ``N'', meaning that players could play Connect 5 or Connect 10. If you'd like to play, say, Connect 7, you can run `python3 src/gui.py --n=7`. To change the number of rows or columns add ``--rows=X`` or ``cols=Y``.
